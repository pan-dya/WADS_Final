            You might ask "Why try to get paid if your goal is to solely help
            others?" Well by earning money not only do we get bigger in name so
            that more people will be aware of our purpose, but also by earning
            money we can do better than before, we can start providing
            facilities like cars and machines to make your job request go
            smoother, that's our reason as to why we need to earn money. All of
            it is for achieving our dream.
